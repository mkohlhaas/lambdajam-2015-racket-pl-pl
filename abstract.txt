Racket: a programming-language programming language
Robby Findler
Northwestern University & PLT

Racket is the best programming language that embraces the premise that
there is no best programming language. In other words, Racket is
designed to support the creation of programming languages which can
then be used to build programs. Using Racket, we have built program
languages ranging from large, general-purpose languages matching
particular programming paradigms to small, specialized programming
languages designed for just a single file in some larger program.

In this talk, I will bring across how it feels to program in such a
language, discuss some of the technical support Racket has to make
such programming practical, and show how Racket's standard libraries
have embraced this perspective, enabling us to include lots of
batteries.
